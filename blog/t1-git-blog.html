	<p><b>What are the benefits of version control?</b></p>

	<p>Version control tells a user when edits were made to a file, what edits were made, who made those edits, and why edits were made to the file. It allows a user to know exactly what functions have been added to a particular program. It also facillitates the unification of files which allows many developers or users to edit and modify a single project or file while also keeping track of all those changes. Without version control, trying to keep track of multiple changes made by many users would be a complete mess.</p>

	<p><b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b></p>

	<p>As a version control system, git gives a history of the content changes made to a file. As you move along in your work, using the commands git add [file name] and git commit -m "[message]" will help you as a user keep track of your changes. </p>

	<p><b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b></p>

	<p>Using GitHub to store code keeps all your code online. This allows other developers to look at your work and work on projects with you more easily.</p>
