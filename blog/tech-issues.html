			<h1>Online Security<div id="date">9-30-2015</div></h1>
			<br>
			<p>With online payment systems becoming increasingly popular, the chances of having your information stolen is at an all time high. Despite, the constant threat of cyberattacks by hackers around the world, for many sites and apps security seems like an afterthough.</p>
			<h2>Common Internet Security Threats:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Spam</li>
				<li>Phishing</li>
				<li>Pharming</li>
				<li>Keyloggers</li>
				<li>Spyware</li>
				<li>Adware</li>
				<li>Virus</li>
				<li>Worms</li>
				<li>Trojan horse</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<h3>Spam</h3>
			<p>Spam is usually in the form of email spam. These email messages can contain links that lead to websites where malicious software can be forcefully downloaded onto your computer.</p>
			<h3>Phishing</h3>
			<p>Phishing scams are sames where cybercriminals try to get a user's private information. These scams are often spam emails disguised as legitimate emails from the bank or even the site hosting the user's email. They trick the user into thinking that they need their private information (usernames, passwords, social secuity numbers, etc.) and weasel the information out of the user.</p>
			<h3>Pharming</h3>
			<p>Pharming is a more phishing scam. Pharming redirects a website's traffic (say a bank's website traffic) to different, fake site. The fake site 'pretends' to be the real site (could be pretending to be a bank's website) to decieve the user into giving up their personal information. Cyber criminals can exploit a vulnerability of DNS server sofware or can change the hosts file on a victim's computer.</p>
			<h3>Keyloggers</h3>
			<p>Keylogging is a software that records the user's keystrokes. By keylogging, cybercriminals can try to parse through the data from the keylogging software to obtain a user's usernames and passwords.</p>
			<h3>Spyware</h3>
			<p>Spyware is a kind of program that is installed (generally without the user's knowledge) after clicking on a popup link or downloading a file from an unknown source. Spyware can be as simple as a keylogging program or as sophisticated as a program that can read and delete a user's files. It can also stream all the information it's collected back to the cybercriminal controlling the spyware.</p>
			<h3>Adware</h3>
			<p>This kind of program launches pop-ups and ads on a user's computer. Sometimes adware is fed information by accompanying spyware that monitor's the user's internet habits and behaviors in order to tailor the ads and pop-ups to that specific user.</p>
			<h3>Virus</h3>
			<p>A virus is a program that copies itself so that it can spread. It will attach to applications and can be spread via USB sticks, CD/DVDs, torrents, regular downloards, copying files from servers, or opening email attachments that are infected with the virus. The virus could corrupt, steal, and delete data on the computer. In a worse case senario, a virus could erase everything on a user's hard drive. A virus could also use any applications the user has installed on their computer (like an email software) to spread the virus to other computers.</p>
			<h3>Worms</h3>
			<p>Worms are quickly spreading malicious sofware programs. A worm can send copies of itself to every contact in a user's address book, leading more computers to be infected (especially because emails from known and trusted contacts will more likely be opened by the new victim).</p>
			<h3>Trojan Horse</h3>
			<p>Torjan horses can be spread by downloading malicious applications. A Trojan Horse can do a multitude of things such as keylongging or taking over a computer's webcam and visually spying on the user.</p>			
			<br>
			<h2>Possible Solutions</h2>
			<p>The best solution would be to educate the general public regarding the security threats that can come from the internet. For example, warning the public against clicking on pop-ups would help to mitigate some risk. </p>
			<p>Additionally, cautioning computer users against giving out private information via email would help keep people from falling for phishing scams. In fact, emails from unknown email addresses shouldn't be opened as malicious software can be downloaded from the email.</p>
			<p>Computer users should also probably be warned that downloading files from unknown or untrusted sources is a surefire way to end up with a virus on the computer. Finally, downloading a good anti-virus software and keeping the computer's firewall up, can help protect the computer to some extent.</p>
