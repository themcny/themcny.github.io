			<h1>Creating My Website<div id="date">11-08-2015</div></h1>
			<br>
			<p>Though I am nowhere near finished with my website, it has been quite a proces to get this far. I started out barely knowing how to bold and italicize text. Now, I am able to add JQuery/JavaScript animations to my site. Learning how to position things where I wantd them in CSS was probably the trickest part of site creation. There are so many features that I plan to add in the future. I liked adding JQuery/CSS animations and I had a lot of fun playing around with different JQuery features. After a while, I found that sometimes less is more when it comes to JQuery though (not everything on the page has to move and be animated).</p>
			<p>I learned that sometimes it's good to stop myself. I got too ambitious with a few features and I wasn't able to implement them as I wanted to. I think having small goals that lead up to the larger product goal would be something to keep in mind for my future projects. Additionally, I learned that when I get stuck or frustrated because one thing isn't working, it is best to step away for a moment and work on something completely different. Taking a break was the best way I found to solve some of the CSS trickery I ran into. </p>
