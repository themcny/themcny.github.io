**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

If you think of content as a box,  the padding is the space between the content box and the border and the margin is the space between the border and the elements surrounding content + border. I learned how to negotiate the amount of padding I wanted between my words and the border. I also figured out how to have the appropriate margins so that my words weren't right next to the edge of the webpage. 


**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

There are four different position values: `static`, `relative`, `fixed`, `absolute`. 


`Static` is the default and you can't change the position using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. 


With `relative` positioning, you can change the top, bottom, right, and left properties to adjust it relative to its normal position.


`Fixed` position means that the position is relative to the viewport. So even if the page is scrolled, the element will stay in the position you've chosen for it (by adjusting the top, bottom, left, and right properties).


`Absolute` positioning means that the element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (so not an element with a 'static' position since positioned elements are elements with non-static position properties). If there is no positioned ancestors, the element will move along the page as it is scrolled.


**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

The sidebar for my homepage index was the most difficult. It was hard to get all the other elements of the page to be positioned properly relative to the rest of the elements on the homepage. After figuring out the difference between fixed and absolute positioning it made positioning the header element and footer elements much easier. The content body was by far the easiest part to position though. It just had to be to the right of the sidebar, above the footer, and below the header. 


**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

Trying to get the formatting to stay the same relative to the viewport is hard. It takes a lot of fiddling pixel by pixel with the element positioning exactly how I wanted. I could have spent another couple of hours trying to get everything 'perfectly' placed.
