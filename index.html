            <h4><a href="/blog/inheritance.html">Inheritance</a></h4>
            <p>Inheritance refers to a relationship between two classes. Ruby is a language that doesn't support multiple inheritance (a feature that allows classes to inherit 'stuff' from multiple classes). A class can inherit from a different class that in turn inherits from a third class, but a single class cannot inherit directly from many different classes. The class that is higher up on the hierarchy (the one who's features are being inherited) is called a super-class or a parent class. The class that is lower on the hierarchy (the classes doing the inheritance) is called the subclass or a child class.<a href="/blog/inheritance.html">(Read More)</a></p>

              <h4><a href="/blog/tech.html">Recursion And Fractals</a></h4>
              <p>A recursive function is one that calls itself within the function. A fractal is a mathematical set or a natural phenomenon that shows a repeating pattern that happens at successively smaller scales. More simply put, a fractal is a never-ending pattern. Not only can we write some complicated functions with recursion (and with fewer lines), we can also use recursion draw fractals. <a href="/blog/tech.html">(Read More)</a></p>

            <h4><a href="/blog/JavaScript.html">Loops in JS vs. Loops in Ruby</a></h4>
            <p>Let's compare for loops in Ruby and JavaScript. To review, in Ruby, a for loop's counter variable does not need to be declared before it is used in the for loop. In JavaScript, a for loop looks a little bit different. In the first line of the loop, we have to declare a variable counter, set it's initial value, and then set the condition for which the loop should run as long as that condition is 'true'. Lastly, we establish how the counter value should increment or decrement. <a href="/blog/JavaScript.html">(Read More)</a></p>

              <p>WhatzCookin is a mobile-responsive web app that takes an ingredient and returns a recipe suggestion based on a userâ€™s preferences. WhatzCookin utilizes a taste algorithm based on the flavors (sweet, spicy, bitter, etc.) of a user's favorited and rated recipes to create a user's taste profile. Using this taste profile, the app suggests a cuisine style (e.g. Italian or Japanese) that user veers towards.</p> 
              <p>WhatCookin utilizes the Spoonacular API for its data and was built using Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.</p>
