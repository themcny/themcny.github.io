		<h3>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h3>
		<p>When writing HTML, sometimes a web developer might want to style certain sections of content a certain way. Perhaps they want one paragraph of text to be bolded (in order to highlight it's importance) while the rest of the text on the page remains 'normal'. Maybe they want the text in a sidebar to be centered but the text in the main content of the page to be aligned left.</p>
		<p>Whatever the case, when styling webpage content (be it images or text or other forms of media), it is useful to use either a 'class' or 'id' to identify what styling should be applied to what section. The primary difference in when to use a class vs an id is that a class is used to style multiple elements the same way whereas an id is used to style a single element</p>
		<p>A class should be used when you want to style more than one element all the same way. For example, if you wanted to style multiple images that appear in the main blog content, you would use a class.</p>
		<p>However, if there was only one element (e.g. a single image in the header of your webpage), you would want to use an 'id' instead.</p>
