			<h1>Inheritance Cheat Sheet<div id="date">10-27-2015</div></h1>

			<h3>Ruby Inheritance</h3>
			
			<p>Inheritance refers to a relationship between two classes. Ruby is a language that doesn't support multiple inheritance (a feature that allows classes to inherit 'stuff' from multiple classes). A class can inherit from a different class that in turn inherits from a third class, but a single class cannot inherit directly from many different classes.</p>
			<p>The class that is higher up on the hierarchy (the one who's features are being inherited) is called a <em>super-class</em> or a <em>parent class</em>. The class that is lower on the hierarchy (the classes doing the inheritance) is called the <em>subclass</em> or a <em>child class</em>.</p>

			<p>We can think of a parent class as a broad category, like food. It describes a lot of different kinds of things and encompasses many different subcategories. All those subcategories might have a common trait (in the case of the subcategories under the umbrella of food, a common trait would be that it is edible).</p>

			<p>That code will put:</p>
			<blockquote>
			<p><code>Yes, it is edible.</code></p>
			<p><code>Yes, it is protein from an animal.</code></p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>However, sometimes, all the traits from the parent class shouldn't be applied to the child class. In this case, it is possible to override those features with more applicable features in a child class.</p>

			<img src="food-rotten.jpg"/>

			<p>That code will put:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><code>No. No longer edible.</code></p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>What about instance variables? How does inheritance work on those? All Ruby objects have instance variables. These instance variabeles are not defined by their object's class. They are created when a value is assigned to them. Therefore, instance variables are not related to the way variables and features are inherited in Ruby.</p>

			<p>Although, it can look like instance variables are inherited, this is usually a result of the fact that the methods (which assign values to those instance variables) are inherited.</p>

			<p>That code will put:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><code>orange</code></p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>In the above code, we put <code>super</code> into the <code>Fruit</code> class's initialize method. <code>super</code> takes the arguments it is given sends those arguments to the method of the same name in the parent of the object invoking <code>super</code>. As you can see above, <code>super</code> is called with one argument; <code>type</code>. So Ruby goes to the parent of the current object (the <code>Fruit</code> class) and invokes the method of the same name (<code>initialize</code>) with the argument(s) passed through <code>super</code> (in this case the <code>type</code>, 'orange'.)</p>

			<p>If we were to use an instance variable named <code>@type</code> in both the parent class (<code>Food</code>) and the child class (<code>Fruit</code>), the instance variable (<code>@type</code>) in the child class (<code>Fruit</code>) would overwrite the value given to that instance variable in the parent class (<code>Food</code>).

			<h3>JavaScript Inheritance</h3>
			
			<p>JavaScript, in contrast to Ruby, has no classes. Instead, in JavaScript every object can be used as a 'prototype' for another object. The prototype defines the functions and members that the object derived from that prototype can use.</p>

			<img src="food-js.jpg"/>

			<p>In the above image, all we've done is create <code>classFood</code>, given it a <code>type</code> property with a value 'edible', and added a <code>display</code> function to <code>classFood</code> that prints the <code>type</code> to the console. Then we've created an instance of <code>classFood</code> and set it equal to a new variable <code>meat</code> before calling the <code>display</code> function on <code>meat</code>.</p>

			<p>So what does that <code>.prototype</code> bit of code do?</p>
			<p>Well every JavaScript function has a prototype property that is empty by default. Properties and methods can be attached to this prototype property in order to implement inheritance. In the above code, we're attaching <code>.display</code> to the prototype property of <code>classFood</code>.</p>

			<img src="fruit-js.jpg"/>

			<p>In the above code, we've established a new function <code>classFruit</code> that has a <code>type</code> property ('Fruit') and a <code>name</code> property ('Orange'). Then in line 20, we set <code>classFruit</code> (the child) to inherit from <code>classFood</code> (the parent).</p>
			<p>Line 22 creates a new instance of <code>classFruit</code>. Despite the fact that we've never explictly set a <code>display</code> function for <code>classFruit</code>, we can (as seen on line 23) use <code>display</code> to print the <code>type</code> property of 'apple'.</p>
