		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am a born and bred San Franciscan.</p>
		<p>By education, I am a mechanical engineer.</p>
		<p>I love cars and playing music. (My interest in cars is what led me to study mechanical engineering in the first place.) I've rebuilt the engine to a kia optima and the manual transmission from a '85 BMW 325e. Currently, I'm fixing up a '99 mustang.</p>
		<p>I've played the violin since I was five and since then I've picked up a couple more instruments. It never occured to me that there would ever be a truly practical use for my musical training and perfect pitch (beyond playing the specific instruments I'd learned). Then, while standing in the parking lot of my high school one day, I heard a car start up and immediately knew from the sound of the starter and engine that it must be a Honda or Acura. Over the next few weeks, I figured out that I could identify car makes by just hearing the sound of the car starting up. I hadn't realized that my love of music and passion for cars would ever intersect to give me the world's weirdest party trick with which to impress people.</p>
